133,Westmalle Trappist Dubbel,Brouwerij Westmalle,Brouwerij Westmalle Westmalle Trappist Dubbel,"Notes:Westmalle Dubbel (7%) is a dark red-brown beer with a rich, complex taste thanks to re-fermentation in the bottle. You pick up touches of caramel, malt and fruity esters reminiscent of ripe banana. The beer pearls beneath a covering of dense, cream-coloured froth. A lovely lace pattern forms on the inside of the glass once emptied. The long, dry finish of this balanced, mild Trappist beer will stay with you.Trappist or Dubbel?In 1865 the monks of Westmalle started brewing a dark Trappist beer in addition to their table beer. They adjusted the recipe in 1926, doubling the amounts of raw ingredients to produce a new, stronger beer. Dubbel is a logical name for this doubled beer, though it is more often simply called ‘Trappist’. To this day, the 1926 recipe is the basis for Westmalle Dubbel.Westmalle Dubbel: bottle and tapWe are all familiar with Westmalle Dubbel in 33 cl bottles. But around 150 carefully selected Belgian cafés and restaurants serve this beer on tap from barrels containing 20, 30 and 50 litres. In the barrel, this living beer evolves differently to emerge with a slightly sweeter taste.Westmalle Dubbel can also be purchased in 75 cl bottles. The beer matures in a different way in a larger bottle to produce a noticeably milder finish.\t",7.0,15.0,30.0,24.0,47.0,39.0,23.0,113.0,49.0,0.0,,33.0,31.0,92.0,4.076998,4.181774,4.058967,4.146199,4.14425,1026.0,2

It’s heritage and popularity are proudly displayed throughout Wisconsin and Illinois — one can’t go far without seeing a historically protected Old Style sign hanging on the side of a barn or in a tavern window.Old Style first crossed state lines into Illinois to capitalize nationwide bottlers strike and subsequent product rationing by the competition. It wasn’t long before Old Style became Chicago’s beer – served from the North Side to the South Side and everywhere in between. Being accepted as a true local, Old Style began sponsoring the Chicago Cubs in 1950. With Old Style still being served at Wrigley Field today, the partnership is one of longest standing in the country.In 2009, Old Style revived the centuries-old German brewing tradition called “Kraeusening.” This double fermentation process increases carbonation and richness, ultimately leading to a better tasting beer that has since been won medals at the Great American Beer Festival and World Beer Cup.\t",4.64,8.0,18.0,13.0,25.0,12.0,20.0,16.0,9.0,0.0,2.0,25.0,4.0,34.0,2.701149,2.864943,2.948276,2.977011,3.324713,174.0,6

488,West Coast Wheat Wine,Baird Brewing Company / Fishmarket Taproom,Baird Brewing Company / Fishmarket Taproom West Coast Wheat Wine,"Notes:Brewer's Notes: Wheat Wine is a beer style born on the U.S. West Coast in the 1980s (legend has it that the style was conceived and first crafted at a small brewery-pub in Sacramento, California). It has as its progenitor the English Barley Wine beer style. Wheat Wine, as a beer style, is characterized by a massively rich complexity imbued with a tenaciously strong-willed sense of balance. It is a style indicative of the irreverent creativity and unrelenting passion for beer that form the hallmarks of craft brewing in the West Coast of the United States. Baird West Coast Wheat Wine is crafted in homage to the skilled brewing artisans and fearless beer entrepreneurs that have pioneered craft brewing on Americas great West Coast.Baird West Coast Wheat Wine is a heavyweight  this year (2005) tipping the scales at approximately 9.5% alcohol by volume. 50 percent of the fermentable extract is derived from malted wheat, and this lends a quenching drinkability rare to beers of this strength. This drinkability is buttressed further by a 10 percent addition of Japanese candy sugar which lends to the beer a character reminiscent of a Belgian-style Tripel. The hops once again are 100% American West Coast types; this year, though, large additions of Vanguard and Sterling render the hop character softer and spicier than last years boldly citrus performance.\t",10.5,45.0,85.0,18.0,45.0,33.0,37.0,96.0,63.0,0.0,,32.0,7.0,70.0,3.791667,3.75,3.791667,3.666667,3.791667,12.0,16

Kriek Lindemans is a good example of that. In order to obtain a beer like no other, we have been adding whole sour cherries to our lambic for generations. Our meeting with American importer Charles Finkel in the 1970s revolutionized the fruit beer segment. Charles convinced us to export our old kriek to the United States by boat. What we had not thought of is that the movement of the waves would reactivate the fermentation process and cause the corks to pop during the trip. It was like something out of The Adventures of Tintin. To prevent that from happening, we therefore developed an alternative production method for our kriek. We use fresh, not from concentrate, unsweetened cherry filtrate which we blend with lambic that is at least one year old before fermenting & macerating for up to 3 days and pasteurizing the whole batch. So the corks don't pop. Due to the use of filtrate and pasteurization, this kriek is sweeter and fruitier than Old Kriek Cuvée René, which undergoes a second fermentation process in the bottle. Thanks to its innovative flavour, it was a resounding success both here in Belgium as well as around the world. Nowadays, it is undoubtedly the reference kriek for consumers.18 IBU\t",3.5,15.0,21.0,22.0,28.0,10.0,3.0,87.0,89.0,0.0,102.0,7.0,9.0,13.0,3.920382,4.031847,3.847134,3.915074,3.83758,471.0,13

220,Devil's Heart Of Gold,Perennial Artisan Ales,Perennial Artisan Ales Heart Of Gold,"Notes:The name ""Devil’s Heart of Gold"" comes from what they call the ""Devil’s Cut"". When a bourbon ages in a barrel, a portion of the bourbon evaporates - this is called the ""Angel’s share"". Another portion of the bourbon gets absorbed into the new oak barrel - this is called the ""Devil’s cut"". Therefore, the Heart of Gold beer aging in the barrel starts to absorb back some of the Devil’s Cut and hence the name ""Devil’s Heart of Gold"". We took our Heart of Gold and aged it in a Knob Creek 9-year old barrel from our friends at The Wine and Cheese Place in October 2011.

The cellars were designed specifically to allow sterile yeast management. The system also allows us to automatically dose the yeast into the fermentation tanks.

It is an unfiltered, naturally cloudy beer with a low carbon dioxide content, and it contains all of the natural sediment. As a result, Kellerbier is rich in valuable nutrients such as yeast, protein, minerals and vitamins.Following the old family tradition, Zeppelin beer is brewed in accordance with the German Purity Law of 1516. As with all of our beers, we use the world-famous Tettnanger aromatic hops, high-quality barley grown in upper Swabia and pure water from the uplands of the Alps. We give the dark amber Zeppelin beer seven weeks to quietly mature. The result is a fully flavoured, mildly malty Kellerbier of the highest quality and goodness with an alcohol content of 5.2 percent. It’s a beer which is almost unrivaled in taste, thanks to its extremely delicately spiced, original flavor.\t",5.2,20.0,40.0,13.0,52.0,18.0,36.0,71.0,,0.0,32.0,52.0,9.0,117.0,3.368421,3.736842,3.763158,,3.684211,19.0,12

This special type of brewing allows a particularly full and also very tasty wheat beer. The amber color comes through special malt, which also brings a caramel-like character and other taste facets in the beer.The cloudiness receives this Benedictine wheat beer by the fine yeast , which means an important flavor carrier for this beer type. This top-fermented yeast gives the wheat beer a very fruity note that is even reminiscent of bananas. A special taste experience is the sweetness, which is to enter into a synergy with the fine dry aroma of the hop.\t",5.4,10.0,15.0,21.0,57.0,14.0,17.0,48.0,47.0,2.0,86.0,24.0,60.0,94.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,1.0,14
